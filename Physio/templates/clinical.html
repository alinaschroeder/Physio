<h1>Clinical Relevance</h1>
<h1 class="minititles">Signs and Symptoms </h1>
<p>The symptoms and signs of Huntington’s disease consist of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances throughout the body [1]. The disease starts out as small twitches at distal extremities, like toes and fingers, and gradually increases to where the patient’s walking becomes unstable. If the disease remains untreated, the motor symptoms increase to a point where unwanted movement spreads to the other muscles. The psychiatric symptoms are usually present in the early stages and prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Depression, irritability, and suicidal tendencies are frequently the early psychiatric symptoms of Huntington’s disease [1]. Cognitive decline can be apparent long before the motor symptoms takes shape. However, it can be very mild in far advance stages of the diseases. Cognitive decline leads to the loss of flexibility in the mind and the patient can no longer make the mental adjustments needed for day to day activities.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of Huntington’s disease first starts off with a detailed history of the patient’s symptoms and a detailed family history [1]. With all the information needed, the diagnosis is not difficult. Imaging, blood tests, and other diagnostic tools are not helpful in diagnosing Huntington’s disease. Brain volume and connections slowly change as the disease progresses. A MRI scan is only helpful when clinical manifestation is present. Therefore, more studies are now focusing on the changes in a MRI scan of the brain before the manifestation. Differential diagnosis is important when evaluating patients who have been wrongly diagnosis and/or does not have the Huntington’s mutation on chromosome 4 [2]. However, differential diagnosis can be complex and lead to unnecessary and expensive procedures [3].</p>

<h1 class="minititles">Treatment</h1>
<p> The treatment of Huntington’s disease depends on the combination of the motor, psychiatric, and cognitive domain. The main goal of the treatment is to delay the symptoms of Huntington’s disease as long as possible. Since there is no cure for the disease, many physicians prescribe drugs to keep the symptoms under control. Tetrabenazine is a dopamine-depleting drug that most effectively reduces the uncontrolled muscle movements, also known as chorea, caused by Huntington’s disease[4]. Other medications for treating chorea are dopamine agonists, glutamate agonists, and benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic drugs are used for the psychiatric symptoms like depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and tricyclic or atypical antidepressant help treat irritability and obsessive-compulsive disorders associated with Huntington’s disease. However, there have been no convincing evidence for the use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and tricyclic or atypical antidepressant for treating Huntington’s disease [5]. There are very limited drugs for treating the cognitive impairments caused by Huntington’s disease. </p>
<p>Also, there is little research about non-pharmaceuticals and surgical treatment strategies to cure or treat the disease [4]. Some new treatments include fetal neural allografts implants in patients. A study was conducted with patients who were grafted with human fetal neuroblasts into the right striatum in the first year and then had the neuroblasts grafted into the left striatum in the next year. The MRI scans and positron emission tomography were taken of these patients and compare to those of patients who have been treated with current treatments. The comparison showed signs of functional, motor, and cognitive improvements in patients with the fetal neural allograft implants [6]. Another new treatment is the use of a compound called PBT2, which is a metal chaperone that affects copper interactions with abnormal proteins in the body. This drug is designed to interrupt interactions between biological metals and target proteins in the brain and to prevent the deterioration of the brain cells. Studies have shown that PBT2 in patients with Alzheimer’s disease may have improved cognition, motor function and control, and reduce the number of brain cell degeneration [5]. Therefore, scientists will hope the PBT2 treatment will extend to Huntington’s disease as well. </p>
